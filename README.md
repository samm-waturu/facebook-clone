## Facebook clone

Facebook clone is a stripped down version of facebook, demonstrating basic social features and UI/UX. Built using Next.JS, Typescript and Firebase.

It features realtime chat capabilities, one way only, and picture upload. One can also sign up using Google, however, i initially implemented authentication using meta's auth API, version difference between Meta's API and Next/Auth Facebook API proved an issue.


## Getting started locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx` or `components/...`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
